# Personal Page ‚Äì Reflection

This project is a personal  webpage built with **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It showcases my profile, skills, and interests, and serves as a practice ground for responsive web design, clean CSS structuring, and semantic HTML.

## üìù What I Learned

### 1. HTML Structure & Semantics
- How to use **semantic elements** like `<section>`, `<div>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, and `<h2>` for better readability and accessibility.
- How to organize content into **logical sections** (Profile, About Me, Skills, Contact).
- How to properly nest elements to avoid clipping issues (e.g., moving the location div outside the image container).

### 2. CSS Layout Techniques
- **Flexbox**:
  - Aligning and centering items horizontally and vertically.
  - Using `flex-direction: column` vs `row` for responsive layouts.
- **Grid**:
  - Creating simple two-column layouts with `grid-template-columns` and easily stacking them on small screens.
- Understanding how **box-model properties** (padding, margin, border-radius) affect layout.

### 3. Responsive Design
- Writing **@media queries** to adjust layouts for different screen sizes.
- Using `flex-wrap` and `min-width` to make sections like ‚ÄúLanguages‚Äù and ‚ÄúSkills‚Äù shrink consistently.
- Adjusting image and font sizes across breakpoints.

### 4. Styling & Design Principles
- Using **border-radius + overflow: hidden** to create circular images.
- Applying **object-fit: cover** to make images fill their container proportionally.
- Styling **progress bars** to represent skill levels visually.
- Adding **hover effects** (like overlays on images) for interactivity.

### 5. Code Organization & Readability
- Grouping related CSS rules into **sections with comments**.
- Keeping properties **consistently indented** and documented with inline comments.
- Avoiding redundant code and maintaining **single-source-of-truth** for repeated styles.

### 6. SVG Icons & Color
- Embedding SVG icons inline for better control over size and color.
- Using the `fill` property to style icons consistently.

## üí° Key Takeaways
- Clean HTML structure makes CSS styling much easier.
- Flexbox and Grid are powerful tools for responsive layouts.
- Grouping and commenting CSS improves readability and maintenance.
- Small details like `overflow: hidden` can impact visibility of nested elements.
- Responsive design should be planned from the start, not as an afterthought.
